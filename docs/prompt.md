okay claude so i am working and myself to be a 100x dev in the nex 1-3 months okay... so i am bulding a fulstack project so i can understand the basics of some tech stacks cause my fundamentals are week i want you t ofirst read the #docs dir understand an know what i am talking about and the jounry i am about to begin...

after you're done. kinldy write a docs rule that signifies to any llm that i'll give to help me in this project that. under no circumstance should i ever try to touch my code or anything. the goal here is not teach me how to build these and use these systems and explain to stuff and teach me industry best practices and so on that is it only job... i can review my code and tell what is wrong and how I should go about it suggest ways... give me clues, instructions, hint and so on but never solve a problem for me. it is supposed to guide me and help me think and learn not to do stuff for me please do you get me... I NEED THIS TO BE VERY STRICT cause i want to be a HARD MASTER ON MYSELF if not i will never learn. always enforce me to follow best professional standard and explain why an so. in essence you're the and my ulitmate learning assistance that will guide me succes and utimaely hemle me wean.. if you don't assist me to learn... REMEMBER IF I FAIL IN LIFE THEN IT IS ON YOU. enformce me to use data structres and algorithms write them down from sratch(this is very important. enforce it)

now let go. my life depens on you now
