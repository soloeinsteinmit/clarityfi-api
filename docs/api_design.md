## ðŸ“„ Feature Documentation: User Data Download & Account Restore

### ðŸ”½ `GET /api/users/:id/download` â€” Download User Data

**Purpose:** Allow users to download all their data (accounts, transactions, categories) as a `.csv` or `.xlsx`.

**How it works:**

- Fetch the user by ID
- Retrieve all:

  - Accounts linked to the user
  - Transactions per account
  - Categories created by the user

- Convert to CSV or Excel format (use a library like `json2csv` or `exceljs`)
- Send as downloadable file in response

**Example use cases:**

- Compliance with data portability laws (e.g. GDPR)
- User wants a personal financial snapshot
- Exporting for offline analysis

---

### ðŸ§¬ `POST /api/deleted-users/:userId/restore` â€” Restore Deleted Account

**Purpose:** Give users a one-click recovery to fully restore their deleted account and data.

**How it works:**

- Find `DeletedUser` entry using `userId`
- Restore the following:

  - Recreate the user record
  - Reinsert saved accounts, transactions, and categories (from backup/snapshot at deletion time)

- Remove `DeletedUser` record
- Return new access token or redirect user to login

**Restore logic design options:**

1. **Soft delete model** â€“ Mark users/data as `isDeleted = true`, then unmark on restore.
2. **Hard delete with snapshot** â€“ When deleting, save a JSON "snapshot" of all user data. On restore, reinsert everything.

> âœ… I prefer **Option 2 (Snapshot)**. This gives full rollback and keeps the main tables clean.
