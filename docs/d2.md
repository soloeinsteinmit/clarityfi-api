Excellent. A great name gives a project an identity and makes it feel real. And you are rightâ€”we need to define the features with military precision. There will be no ambiguity. This is your detailed blueprint.

First, let's name the project. We want something that sounds modern, trustworthy, and hints at intelligence.

**Project Name:** **ClarityFi**

- **Clarity:** Speaks to financial transparency and understanding.
- **Fi:** Short for Finance.
- It's clean, professional, and memorable.

**Repository Structure:** You are correct. This will be a monorepo or three separate repositories.

1.  `clarityfi-api` (The Node.js Backend)
2.  `clarityfi-web` (The Next.js Frontend)
3.  `clarityfi-ai` (The Python AI Agent)

**Tech Stack:**

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Framework:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (with Neon)
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Authentication:** JWT with `jsonwebtoken`, `bcrypt`
- **Validation:** `Zod`
- **Testing:** Vitest

| Feature                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Key Learnings                                                                    | Complexity |
| :------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| **1. Database Schema**          | Design the data models for `User`, `Account` (e.g., checking, savings), and `Transaction` using the Prisma schema language. Define the relationships (a User has many Accounts, an Account has many Transactions).                       | Relational data modeling, primary/foreign keys, database migrations.             | **Medium** |
| **2. User Auth Endpoints**      | Create `/api/auth/register` and `/api/auth/login` endpoints. Hash passwords with `bcrypt` on registration. On login, verify the password and issue a JWT containing the `userId`.                                                        | Password security, hashing algorithms, JWT principles, stateless authentication. | **Medium** |
| **3. Protected Middleware**     | Write an Express middleware that checks for a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header of incoming requests. It should decode the token, verify its signature, and attach the `userId` to the request object for use in protected routes. | Middleware concepts, security best practices, error handling for auth.           | **Medium** |
| **4. CRUD: Accounts**           | Create protected endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) at `/api/accounts` to manage a user's financial accounts. Ensure a user can only access _their own_ accounts.                                                                | RESTful API design, database CRUD operations, business logic in controllers.     | **Low**    |
| **5. CRUD: Transactions**       | Create protected endpoints at `/api/accounts/:accountId/transactions` to manage transactions within a specific account. A user should only be able to add transactions to an account they own.                                           | Nested routes, complex authorization logic, data integrity.                      | **Medium** |
| **6. Input Validation**         | Use `Zod` to create validation schemas for all request bodies (`POST`, `PUT`). If validation fails, return a clear `400 Bad Request` error with details.                                                                                 | Data validation patterns, defensive programming, API contracts.                  | **Medium** |
| **7. Unit & Integration Tests** | Write tests for your API. Use an in-memory database or a test database to test your endpoints. Test the success cases, failure cases (e.g., bad input), and security (e.g., user A cannot access user B's data).                         | Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, mocking, assertions, API testing.      | **High**   |

| Feature                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Key Learnings                                                                              | Complexity |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| **1. Project Setup & UI**         | Set up a Next.js project. Integrate Tailwind and Shadcn/ui. Build the main layout components (sidebar, navbar, main content area).                                                                                                                 | Modern frontend tooling, component-based architecture, responsive design.                  | **Low**    |
| **2. Auth Pages & Flow**          | Build the `/login` and `/register` pages using Shadcn form components. On successful submission, call your `clarityfi-api`, store the received JWT securely in browser storage (e.g., `localStorage` or `httpOnly` cookie), and redirect the user. | Client-side auth flows, handling user sessions, protected routes in Next.js.               | **Medium** |
| **3. API Client & Data Fetching** | Create a centralized API client (e.g., using `axios`) that automatically attaches the JWT to all requests. Use TanStack Query to fetch, cache, and manage server state for accounts and transactions.                                              | Server state management, caching strategies, reducing network requests.                    | **Medium** |
| **4. Main Dashboard**             | Create the main dashboard page (`/`). It should display a "Total Balance" card (sum of all account balances), a list of recent transactions from all accounts, and a spending summary chart.                                                       | Data aggregation on the client, component composition, prop drilling vs. state mgt.        | **Medium** |
| **5. Data Visualization**         | On the dashboard, implement a Recharts pie chart showing spending by category for the current month. The data will need to be processed on the client side from the fetched transactions.                                                          | Data visualization libraries, transforming data for charting, creating interactive charts. | **Medium** |
| **6. Interactive CRUD Forms**     | Build a "New Transaction" feature, likely within a modal dialog. The form should allow users to select one of their accounts, enter an amount, category, and date. Implement client-side validation and provide loading/success/error states.      | Complex form state, controlled components, user feedback patterns.                         | **High**   |
| **7. Responsive Design**          | Ensure the entire application is fully responsive and usable on mobile devices. The sidebar should collapse into a hamburger menu, and cards/tables should reflow gracefully.                                                                      | Tailwind's responsive prefixes, mobile-first design philosophy.                            | **Medium** |

### **Phase 3: The AI Analyst (`clarityfi-ai`)**

**Goal:** Layer on a "wow" feature that demonstrates your AI engineering skills and architectural thinking.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Language:** Python
- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **AI Logic:** LangChain or LlamaIndex
- **LLMs:** OpenAI API (or another provider like Anthropic/Claude)

| Feature                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Key Learnings                                                                              | Complexity |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| **1. AI Service Setup**       | Create a new FastAPI project. This will be a separate service from your Node.js API. It will have its own endpoints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Microservice architecture, Python web frameworks, managing dependencies.                   | **Low**    |
| **2. Secure Data Access API** | In your `clarityfi-api` (Node.js), create a new, highly protected endpoint (e.g., `/api/internal/user-data`). This endpoint will only be callable by your `clarityfi-ai` service (using a secret API key). It will return all transaction data for a given user.                                                                                          | Inter-service communication, API key security, service-level authorization.                | **Medium** |
| **3. The "Insight" Agent**    | In your `clarityfi-ai` service, create an endpoint `/agent/insights`. This endpoint will receive a `userId`. It will then call the Node.js `/user-data` endpoint to get the user's transactions, format this data into a text prompt, and send it to an LLM with instructions like "Analyze this user's spending and provide three interesting insights." | Prompt engineering, structuring data for LLMs, handling API calls to LLM providers.        | **Medium** |
| **4. The "Q&A" Agent**        | Create another endpoint `/agent/query`. This will receive a `userId` and a natural language question (e.g., "how much did I spend on food?"). The agent will use an LLM function/tool-calling feature. You'll define a "tool" that can programmatically query the transaction data. The LLM will decide which tool to use based on the user's question.   | LLM Tool/Function Calling, designing data schemas for tools, agentic loops.                | **High**   |
| **5. Frontend Integration**   | In your `clarityfi-web` (Next.js) app, add a new "Clarity AI" section. Build a simple chat interface. When a user sends a message, it calls the appropriate endpoint on your `clarityfi-ai` service and displays the response in a streaming fashion.                                                                                                     | Building chat UIs, handling streaming text responses, client-side state for conversations. | **High**   |

This is your roadmap. It is hard. It is comprehensive. There is nowhere to hide. If you build this, you will have mastered the fundamentals of full-stack engineering and proven you can architect complex, multi-service AI applications. Print this out. This is your bible for the next three months. Go build.
