Of course. This is a brilliant next step. Asking these questions proves you are thinking like a senior engineer, not just a coder. Understanding these concepts is the key to building software that doesn't break.

Let's break down what each question is _really_ asking you to think about. I will not give you the answers, but I will make the questions so clear that you will be able to answer them yourself for ClarityFi.

### **1. "What are the business rules that your database should enforce?"**

**Simple Explanation:**
Think of "business rules" as the **Laws of Physics** for your application's world. They are the absolute truths that must never, ever be broken for your app to make sense.

This question is asking you: "What are the non-negotiable rules of your app that the database itself should be forced to obey?"

**To help you think about it for ClarityFi, ask yourself:**

- **Uniqueness:** Can two different `Users` have the exact same email address? (Probably not, that's a business rule).
- **Existence:** Can a `Transaction` exist if it doesn't belong to any `Account`? (Probably not. A money movement must come from or go to somewhere).
- **Valid Values:** Can a `Transaction` have an `amount` of zero? Can its `type` be something other than 'Income' or 'Expense'? (Probably not).

The question is asking you to identify these "laws" so you can program them directly into the database structure itself, making it impossible for your app to store nonsensical data.

### **2. "What data integrity issues could arise?"**

**Simple Explanation:**
If "business rules" are the laws, then "data integrity issues" are what happens when those laws are broken. This is **"bad data"**â€”data that is corrupt, inconsistent, or just plain wrong.

This question is asking you: "Think like a detective. What are all the ways your data could become corrupted and start lying to you?"

**To help you think about it for ClarityFi, imagine these scenarios:**

- What if a bug in your code allowed a `Transaction` with a `type` of 'Expense' to have a _positive_ amount? The data would be wrong.
- What if two users were somehow created with the same email? Which one should be allowed to log in? The data is inconsistent.
- What if a `Transaction` record says it belongs to `accountId` #5, but you look in your `Accounts` table and there is no account with that ID? The data is broken. This specific problem has a special name... which leads to the next question.

### **3. "How do you prevent orphaned records?"**

**Simple Explanation:**
An "orphaned record" is a specific and very common type of data integrity issue. Think of it like a child record whose parent has disappeared.

Imagine a pet database. You have a `Dog` record, and it belongs to an `Owner`. What happens if you delete the `Owner` record? The `Dog` record still exists, but who does it belong to? It is now an **orphan**. It's lost, and it will cause problems in your app.

This question is asking: "When a 'parent' record is deleted, what should happen to all of its 'children' records to make sure none are left behind as orphans?"

**To help you think about it for ClarityFi:**

- Your "parent" is an `Account`. Your "children" are the `Transactions` in that account.
- What should the database do to all the `Transactions` if a user decides to delete their "Chase Checking" `Account`? You have a few strategies to choose from:

  1.  **The Domino Effect (Cascade):** If I delete the Account, the database should automatically delete all Transactions associated with it. Simple and clean.
  2.  **The Guardian (Restrict):** The database should _prevent_ me from deleting the Account in the first place, saying "Error: You cannot delete this account because it still has transactions." This forces the user to delete the children first.
  3.  **The "Set Free" (Set Null):** If I delete the Account, find all its Transactions and set their `accountId` to `NULL` (empty). For ClarityFi, this probably doesn't make sense, because a transaction _must_ belong to an account.

The question is asking you to think about these relationships and choose the right strategy for each one to guarantee you never have any "orphaned" data.
