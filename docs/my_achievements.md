# LOGGING: New things i have learnt and understand

## âœ… What You Got Right:

#### **Algorithm for Balance Calculation**

Your pseudocode is correct - filter by posted status, sum credits, subtract debits. This is exactly how financial ledgers work.

#### **State Machine Design**

Your Mermaid diagram captures the essential transaction flow. The transitions make business sense.

#### **Validation Rules**

You've covered the critical validations and understood the debit/credit logic with proper constraints.

## **ðŸŽ¯ Areas That Show Deep Understanding:**

1. **You grasped the ledger concept** - transactions are immutable records, balance is derived
2. **You understood state transitions** - no going backwards from final states
3. **You applied accounting principles** - debit/credit from account perspective
4. **You considered data integrity** - foreign key constraints, enum validations
