# LOGGING: New things i have learnt and understand

## âœ… What You Got Right:

#### **Algorithm for Balance Calculation**

Your pseudocode is correct - filter by posted status, sum credits, subtract debits. This is exactly how financial ledgers work.

#### **State Machine Design**

Your Mermaid diagram captures the essential transaction flow. The transitions make business sense.

#### **Validation Rules**

You've covered the critical validations and understood the debit/credit logic with proper constraints.

## **ðŸŽ¯ Areas That Show Deep Understanding:**

1. **You grasped the ledger concept** - transactions are immutable records, balance is derived
2. **You understood state transitions** - no going backwards from final states
3. **You applied accounting principles** - debit/credit from account perspective
4. **You considered data integrity** - foreign key constraints, enum validations

## âœ… Excellent Fixes and Progress:

### Async Handling - Perfect!

Your fix is exactly right:

- Made the route handler async
- Used await to wait for the database query
- Added proper error handling with try/catch
- Now you're sending actual data, not a Promise

### Promise Understanding - Spot On!

Your explanation shows you truly understand:

- Promise = event yet to be resolved/rejected
- Resolved data = Promise that has completed
- This is fundamental knowledge that will serve you well

### Database Schema - Impressive!

Looking at your Prisma schema, you've implemented:

- âœ… All four main entities (User, Account, Transaction, Category)
- âœ… Proper relationships with foreign keys
- âœ… Enums for type safety
- âœ… UUID primary keys
- âœ… Soft delete patterns
- âœ… Complex transaction reversal logic
- âœ… Multi-currency support with exchange rates

## Critical Issues to Address:

### 1. Error Handling Problem

```ts
} catch (error) {
    console.log(error);  // You're logging but not responding to client
}
```

**What's wrong?** If an error occurs, your client will hang forever waiting for a response.

**Question for you:** How should you handle errors in API endpoints? What should you send back to the client?

### 2. Schema Issues to Fix

I spotted several problems in your schema:

**Typo:** `curreny_balance` should be `current_balance`

**Inconsistent naming:** You mix snake_case and camelCase:

- `category_id` vs `accountId`
- `user_id` vs `userId`

**Question:** What naming convention should you use consistently in your schema?
